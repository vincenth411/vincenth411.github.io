# Overview

<img src="img/working.gif" alt="debugging demo gif">

In this project, the code is already written, but it’s broken! Your job is to find and fix the bugs using console errors and the Chrome debugger. The techniques used in the program may be new, but don’t worry. With careful observation and debugging tools, you’ll be able to trace through the logic and make everything work again.

# Lesson Steps

🔍 To begin your debugging journey, open the `asd-debugging-exercise` folder and launch the HTML file using Live Server. Then, press `F12` to open Chrome DevTools — your trusty magnifying glass for hunting down errors. You’ll be using both the **Console** and **Sources** tabs to solve the mystery.

Keep this tab open throughout your project, and check in after every change until you track down every bug! 🕵️‍♀️

> ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT
>
> **DO NOT** just go through deleting red squiggles! Some of the syntax may look strange but is completely correct. Rely on the **stack trace** and **step-through debugging** to guide your fixes; otherwise, you might “fix” something that was never broken.

# TODO 1: Find Extra, Missing, or Incorrect Symbols and Keywords

## **TODO 1: Find Extra, Missing, or Incorrect Symbols and Keywords**

🎯 **Goal:** Use the developer tools console to locate and fix syntax issues caused by missing or incorrect symbols and keywords.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Open your project in Live Server and launch the **Chrome Developer Tools** (F12).
2. Go to the **Console** tab to view any error messages.
3. Use the console messages and stack traces to locate each of the following:
   - A misspelled keyword (e.g., `funtion`, `iff`, etc.)
   - A missing or extra symbol (such as a curly brace, parenthesis, or semicolon)
4. There are **FOUR** errors of this type in total. Fix each one carefully by using the debugger output rather than guessing.

> ⚠️ **Use the console to find each error.** If you try to hunt them down manually, you may miss one or break working code. The console is your most accurate source of truth.

### ✅ **Check Your Work**

- Open the console in DevTools.
- If your fixes are successful, you should now see a **ReferenceError for `maXX`** in the console.
- **Do not move forward until this message appears.** It confirms you've cleared the first layer of errors.

<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 2: Find All Typos**

🎯 **Goal:** Use the console to identify and fix typos in variable or function names that are causing runtime errors.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Open your project with Live Server and keep the **Console** tab of DevTools open.
2. Look for **ReferenceErrors** that point to undefined variables or functions.
3. There are **THREE** such typos in total. These may include:
   - Misspelled variable names
   - Incorrect capitalization
   - Calling a function by the wrong name
4. Carefully correct each typo based on what the console messages are reportin and how you see these and similar terms spelled on other lines.

> ⚠️ **Don't assume the program is fixed just because something appears on the screen.** You may see some circles before this step is complete, but that does not mean all errors are resolved.

### ✅ **Check Your Work**

- Open the console in DevTools.
- You should **no longer see any ReferenceErrors**.
- If any ReferenceErrors are still present, **do not move forward** until they are resolved.

# TODO 3: Get the Circles Moving

🎯 **Goal:** Use the Chrome debugger to step through the program and discover why the circles aren’t appearing or moving.

---

### 🔎 Review Before You Begin

Before diving into the debugging steps, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the **DevTools control panel**:

<img src="img/panel.png" alt="DevTools control panel">

- Hover over each icon in Chrome’s **Sources** tab to learn what they do.
- Pay special attention to:
  - Resume script execution
  - Step into function
  - Step over next function call
  - Step out of current function

These will be your primary tools for navigating the code frame-by-frame.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Open the **Sources** tab in DevTools and click on the `index.js` file to view your code.
2. Click on **line 92** (the start of the `update` function) to place a **breakpoint**. This function runs once per frame and controls all movement logic.

<img src="img/breakpoint.gif" alt="how to add a breakpoint gif">

3. Refresh the page. Your code should pause at the breakpoint.
4. Hover your mouse over the variables `i`, `maxCircles`, and `circles`. Take note of their current values.

> **💡 Why line 92?**  
> That `for` loop sets up how many times the circle logic runs. If `maxCircles` is wrong, this loop won't behave as expected.

5. Click the **Resume** button to continue execution and watch for changes.
6. Notice that `maxCircles` becomes `0` — this is the source of the issue. Now your task is to **track where that value is changed**.
7. Refresh the page and instead of resuming, try using the **Step Into** button to walk through the program one line at a time.
8. Watch for the moment where `maxCircles` is reassigned or manipulated. When you find the cause, fix it in the code.

> ⚠️ **Heads up:**  
> If you accidentally step into jQuery or external code, either hit the **Step Out** button or refresh the page and resume stepping again — you're only interested in _your_ code.

### ✅ **Check Your Work**

- Open your project with Live Server.
- When the program runs correctly, all the circles should:
  - Stick to the **left** side of the screen at first
  - Then slowly migrate to the **bottom** of the box
- **Do not move forward** until you see this exact behavior.

<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 4: Fix Horizontal Movement**

🎯 **Goal:** Use breakpoints and the step-through debugger to identify why the circles are not moving left or right.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

> 💡 You may have already spotted this bug while working on TODO 3. If you’ve fixed it, you’re ahead, but if not, follow the steps below to uncover the issue.

1. Remove your previous breakpoint (line 92) by clicking it again in the **Sources** tab.
2. In the `update` function, examine the three function calls:
   - `moveCircle(...)`
   - `bounceCircle(...)`
   - `updateCircleOnScreen(...)`  
     Which one seems most likely to handle horizontal motion?
3. Place a **breakpoint** on that line.
4. Refresh the page to trigger the breakpoint.
5. Use the **Step Into** button to enter the function and examine what’s happening.
   - If you land inside jQuery or see unfamiliar code, click **Resume** and try again.
6. Look for missing or incorrect logic that would prevent left/right movement, then fix it.

> 🔁 **Reminder:** Because the `update` function runs every frame, your breakpoint will be hit again after you click **Resume**, allowing you to easily retry with a new approach.

---

### ✅ **Check Your Work**

- Open your project with Live Server.
- When the program runs correctly, all the circles should:
  - No longer stick to the **left** side
  - But should still drop to the **bottom**
- **Do not move forward** until all circles move freely left and right without clinging to the wall.

<br><br><br><br>

## **TODO 5: Fix Sticky Circles**

🎯 **Goal:** Track down why the circles are sticking to the bottom of the screen instead of bouncing, and fix the logic causing it.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Start with a clean slate by removing any previous breakpoints.
2. Return to the `update` function and once again examine the three key function calls:
   - `moveCircle(...)`
   - `bounceCircle(...)`
   - `updateCircleOnScreen(...)`  
     Which one seems responsible for detecting and handling collisions?
3. Place a **breakpoint** at the line you think is most relevant.
4. Refresh the page and use the **Step Into** button to begin walking through the logic.
5. Watch for any conditions or calculations that might be missing or incorrect — especially related to reversing direction on impact.
6. When you find the bug, fix the logic so the circles **bounce off** the bottom of the box instead of sticking to it.

> 💡 **Hint:** You’ve done this dance before. Rely on what you learned in TODO 4, and think carefully about which function actually handles boundary collisions.
